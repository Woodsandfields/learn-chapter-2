This is from the [second chapter](https://learn.r-journalism.com/enjson-files/) of [learn.r-journalism.com](https://learn.r-journalism.com/).


JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is the data structure behind many website features like maps.


## Tracking down a website's JSON

Let's say theoretically you were interested in compiling a list of all Sinclair Broadcast TV stations and their locations.

You'd first visit their [web site](http://sbgi.net/).

And then you might find they have [a map](http://sbgi.net/tv-stations/)!

Look at the developer tools in your browser and click over to **Network** you could sort by size and see there's a **json** file being called by the map.

If you click into the json link you'll see this data structure that includes affiliation, call letters, and latitude and longitude.

Here's a close up.

## Importing JSON

It looks like it could be transformed into rectangular data frame so we can analyze it.

## jsonlite package

We're going to use the [**jsonlite** ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/vignettes/json-aaquickstart.html)

First, install and load the package.

```{r import}
#install.packages("jsonlite")
library(jsonlite)
```

Then point to where the json file is. You can use the URL or the local path to it if you've downloaded it. I recommend downloading it as a backup in case the website is restructured.

Use the `fromJSON()` function.

```{r json_address}
json_url <-"http://sbgi.net/resources/assets/sbgi/MetaverseStationData.json"

## If the url above doesn't exist anymore uncomment the line below and run it
# json_url <- "data/MetaverseStationData.json"

stations <- fromJSON(json_url)
```

Let's look at the structure of what we've imported.

```{r structure}
str(stations)
```

And how's it now look as a data frame?

```{r view1, eval=F}
View(stations)
```

Alright, this is a great start.

We can proceed to analyzing it and maybe visualizing it ourselves on a map.

But we'll get to that in later chapters.
