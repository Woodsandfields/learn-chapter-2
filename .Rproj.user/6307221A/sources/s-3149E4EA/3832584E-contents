## Chapter 2

These files and folders are meant to accompany the second chapter from the learn.r-journalism.com class.

To make sure these files work please make sure the project directory is set up correctly: *Session > Set Working Directory > To Project Directory *

When you type `getwd()` it should look something like `your_file_path/learn-r-chapter-2`

Navigate to the .rmd files for each sub-chapter to open and follow along with each section.

Or you can execute the following commands in the console to bring up the files.

* `file.edit("copying_pasting/copying-pasting.Rmd")`
* `file.edit("csv/csv.Rmd")`
* `file.edit("delimited_text/delimited_text.Rmd")`
* `file.edit("excel/excel.Rmd")`
* `file.edit("json/json.Rmd")`
* `file.edit("spss/spss.Rmd")`

To view the local html version of the .rmd files, you can try the following commands in your console to see rendered version of the sub-chapter:

* `browseURL("copying_pasting/copying-pasting.html")`
* `browseURL("csv/csv.html")`
* `browseURL("delimited_text/delimited_text.html")`
* `browseURL("excel/excel.html")`
* `browseURL("json/json.html")`
* `browseURL("spss/spss.html")`
